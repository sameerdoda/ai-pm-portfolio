# AI Product Management Portfolio – Sameer Doda
AI Product Management portfolio: hands-on LLM, RAG, and agentic projects with full PRDs, evaluations, and case studies.

# Why this repo exists?
- Build a public, interview-ready AI Product Management portfolio that demonstrates real shipped projects rather than just theory.
- Develop strong technical depth in LLMs, RAG systems, and agents so I can work effectively with engineers and data scientists.
- Practice the full AI product lifecycle end to end: opportunity discovery, PRDs, prototyping, evaluation, and iteration.
- Create 3–4 substantial AI projects (internal tool, RAG assistant, domain-specific feature) with clear metrics and case studies.
- Document my learning journey week by week so I can reflect, improve, and signal long-term commitment to AI PM.

# Projects at a glance
- Project 1 – Internal LLM Tool: A prompt-based internal assistant (e.g. launch announcement writer) to improve team productivity.
- Project 2 – RAG Knowledge Assistant: A retrieval-augmented chatbot that answers questions grounded in real documents with citations and confidence signals.
- Project 3 – Domain AI Feature: A user-facing AI feature in a chosen domain (e.g., B2B SaaS or productivity) that goes from PRD to MVP, beta, and launch.
