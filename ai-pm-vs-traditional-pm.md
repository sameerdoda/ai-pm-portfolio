# AI PM vs Traditional PM

## 1. Core mission

- **Traditional PM:** Understand customer problems, define solutions, ship features, and drive business outcomes (adoption, revenue, retention).
- **AI PM:** Do all of the above, but with AI/ML as a core lever, ensuring that data and models actually improve outcomes rather than just adding “AI” to the roadmap.

## 2. What creates value

- **Traditional PM:** Value comes mainly from UX, workflows, and feature design (what the product does and how it feels).
- **AI PM:** Value comes from data and model behavior as much as from UX; the “magic” is in predictions, personalization, summarization, and automation powered by models.

## 3. How the product behaves

- **Traditional PM:** Products are mostly deterministic; the same input leads to the same output, making behavior easier to specify and test.
- **AI PM:** Products are probabilistic; the same input can produce different outputs, so you think in distributions, error rates, and failure modes rather than simple pass/fail.

## 4. Development & lifecycle

- **Traditional PM:** Plan → build → test → launch → measure, with relatively stable behavior after launch.
- **AI PM:** Discover → collect data → train/tune models → test/evaluate → launch → continuously monitor and retrain, because data and model performance drift over time.

## 5. Stakeholders & collaboration

- **Traditional PM:** Close partners are engineers, designers, marketing, sales, and customer success.
- **AI PM:** All of the above plus data scientists, ML engineers, data/platform teams, and often legal, security, and ethics, with extra work to align technical metrics with user and business outcomes.

## 6. Skills and decision‑making

- **Traditional PM:** Strong product sense, user research, prioritization, execution, communication, and business acumen.
- **AI PM:** Needs all traditional skills plus working literacy in data, ML/LLMs, evaluation metrics, experimentation, and responsible AI (bias, fairness, transparency, governance).

## 7. Risks and responsibilities

- **Traditional PM:** Primary risks are usability issues, bugs, poor market fit, or missed business targets.
- **AI PM:** Inherits those risks and adds new ones: biased or harmful outputs, hallucinations, misuse of data, regulatory exposure, and erosion of user trust if AI behaves opaquely.
